	abstract = {Microplastic pollution is a growing public concern as these particles are ubiquitous in various environments and can fragment into smaller nanoplastics. Another environmental concern arises from widely used engineered nanoparticles. Despite the increasing abundance of these nano-sized pollutants and the possibility of interactions with organisms at the sub cellular level, with many risks still being unknown, there are only a few publications on this topic due to the lack of reliable techniques for nanoparticle characterization. We propose a multi-technique approach for the characterization of nanoparticles down to the 10 nm level using standard micro-Raman spectroscopy combined with standard atomic force microscopy. We successfully obtained single-particle spectra from 25 nm sized polystyrene and 9 nm sized {TiO}2 nanoparticles with corresponding mass limits of detection of 8.6 ag (attogram) and 1.6 ag, respectively, thus demonstrating the possibility of achieving an unambiguous Raman signal from a single, small nanoparticle with a resolution comparable to more complex and time-consuming technologies such as Tip-Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy and Photo-Induced Force Microscopy.},

	abstract = {This study characterizes the microstructure and mineralogy of 132 ({ODP} sample), 1000 and 1880 million-year-old chert samples. By using ultra-small-angle X-ray scattering ({USAXS}), wide-angle X-ray scattering and other techniques, the preservation of organic matter ({OM}) in these samples is studied. The scarce microstructural data reported on chert contrast with many studies addressing porosity evolution in other sedimentary rocks. The aim of this work is to solve the distribution of {OM} and silica in chert by characterizing samples before and after combustion to pinpoint the {OM} distribution inside the porous silica matrix. The samples are predominantly composed of alpha quartz and show increasing crystallite sizes up to 33 ± 5 nm (1σ standard deviation or {SD}). In older samples, low water abundances (∼0.03\%) suggest progressive dehydration. (U){SAXS} data reveal a porous matrix that evolves over geological time, including, from younger to older samples, (1) a decreasing pore volume down to 1\%, (2) greater pore sizes hosting {OM}, (3) decreasing specific surface area values from younger (9.3 ± 0.1 m

              , 1σ {SD}) and (4) a lower background intensity correlated to decreasing hydrogen abundances. The pore-volume distributions ({PVDs}) show that pores ranging from 4 to 100 nm accumulate the greater volume fraction of {OM}. Raman data show aromatic organic clusters up to 20 nm in older samples. Raman and {PVD} data suggest that {OM} is located mostly in mesopores. Observed structural changes, silica–{OM} interactions and the hydrophobicity of the {OM} could explain the {OM} preservation in chert.},

	abstract = {In recent years, Candida auris has emerged as a hazardous hospital-acquired pathogen. Its resistance to antifungal treatments makes it challenging, requiring new approaches to manage it effectively. Herein, we aimed to assess the impact of photodynamic inactivation mediated by methylene blue ({MB}-{PDI}) or 1,9-dimethyl {MB} ({DMMB}-{PDI}) combined with a red {LED} against C. auris. To evaluate the photoinactivation of yeasts, we quantified colony-forming units and monitored {ROS} production. To gain some insights into the differences between {MB} and {DMMB}, we assessed lipid peroxidation ({LPO}) and mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm). After, we verified the effectiveness of {DMMB} against biofilms by measuring metabolic activity and biomass, and the structures were analyzed through scanning electron microscopy and optical coherence tomography. We also evaluated the cytotoxicity in mammalian cells. {DMMB}-{PDI} successfully eradicated C. auris yeasts at 3 μM regardless of the light dose. In contrast, {MB} (100 μM) killed cells only when exposed to the highest dose of light. {DMMB}-{PDI} promoted higher {ROS}, {LPO} and ΔΨm levels than those of {MB}. Furthermore, {DMMB}-{PDI} was able to inhibit biofilm formation and destroy mature biofilms, with no observed toxicity in fibroblasts. We conclude that {DMMB}-{PDI} holds great potential to combat the global threat posed by C. auris.},

	abstract = {Nd3+-doped {GeO}2-{PbO} glass with silver (Ag) nanoparticles ({NPs}) are produced with double line waveguides through fs laser processing for photonic applications. A Ti:sapphire fs laser at 800 nm was used to write the waveguides directly into the glass 0.7 mm beneath the surface. This platform is based on pairs of parallel lines with spacing of 10 µm, each pair being formed by two identical written lines but in two different configurations of 4 or 8 separately processed lines, which are coincident. The results of optical microscopy, absorbance measurements, refractive index change, beam quality factor (at 632 and 1064 nm), photoluminescence, propagation losses, and relative gain at 1064 nm are presented. The structural changes in the glass due to the presence of Ag {NPs} were investigated by Raman spectroscopy. At 632 and 1064 nm, x,y-symmetrical guiding was observed, and for both kinds of overlapping pulses, a refractive index alteration of 10−3 was found in both directions. Photoluminescence growth of {\textasciitilde}47\% at 1064 nm was observed due to the plasmonic effect of Ag {NPs}. In dual waveguides containing Ag {NPs}, the relative gain obtained increased by 40\% and 30\% for four and eight overlapping lines, respectively, at 600 {mW} of 808 nm pump power, when compared to waveguides without those metallic {NPs}. We highlight the resultant positive internal gains of 5.11 and 7.12 {dB}/cm that showed a growth of {\textasciitilde}40\% and {\textasciitilde}30\%, respectively, with respect to the samples without Ag {NPs}. The increase in photoluminescence and relative gain were related to the local field growth produced by Ag {NPs}. The present results show that the addition of Ag {NPs} impacts positively on the optical performance at 1064 nm of double line waveguides processed by fs laser writing in Nd3+-doped {GeO}2-{PbO} glass, opening news perspectives for photonics.},

These observations may indicate strong photon correlation in strongly localized electromagnetic modes, inducing successive photon interactions with the atoms or molecules.

However, current studies on adult anuran amphibians focus on assessing only one exposure route, the digestive system, while other routes remain underestimated. Therefore, this present study aimed to evaluate the degree of contamination in the digestive, respiratory, and integumentary systems, in situ, of two endemic Amazonian adult anuran species (\textit{Physalaemus ephippifer} and \textit{Boana multifasciata}). From this, we identified and characterized microplastic particles for each exposure route, assessed the effects of morphometric measures on the total {MP} contamination level and in the gastrointestinal tract ({GIT}). Additionally, we determined different contamination indices and how they vary according to species and systems. Based on our data, the digestive and integumentary exposure routes showed the highest contamination levels for both species. Additionally, variations in {MP} contamination levels indicated that \textit{P. ephippifer} had a higher level of {MP} contamination. Thus, this study provides the first evidence of microplastic exposure through respiratory and integumentary routes in adult anurans in situ, and it is the first to identify {MP} contamination in terrestrial biomonitors in the Amazon.},

Utilizing silicone tissue phantoms as a background medium and spatial frequency domain imaging ({SFDI}) to measure the tissues’ optical properties, we constructed a lookup table ({LUT}) to infer the optical properties of embedded {AuNPs} with varying spatial concentrations and depths across multiple spatial frequencies. An analytical solution derived from the {LUT} facilitated the determination of embedded {NP} concentration in-depth as a function of measured spatial frequency-dependent optical absorption. Notably, {SFDI} enabled the spatial localization of {NPs} in three dimensions.

              Investigating the molecular mechanism underlying the aggregation process of amyloid fibers is of great importance both for its implications in several degenerative diseases and for the design of new materials based on self-assembly. In particular, micro/nanotubes of L,L-diphenylalanine have been investigated as a model of amyloid plaques in Alzheimer's disease and also for their broad range of physical properties,
              e.g.
              , good thermo- and mechanical stability, semiconductivity, piezoelectricity and optical properties. It has been reported that the assembly/disassembly dynamics of L,L-diphenylalanine crystals is influenced by the solvent composition being triggered by evaporation of solvents. In fact the solvatomorphism of this peptide-based nanomaterial is complex and rich attracting great attention. Here we investigated the growing kinetics of the micro/nanotubes of L,L-diphenylalanine in samples prepared with toluene, ethanol, and acetic acid solvents by time-resolved Raman spectroscopy. Our results indicated that the self-assembly in this case competes with the water evaporation process contrary to what is reported by samples prepared with widely used solvent 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro-2-propanol. We note that exclusively tubular structures (being hollow for the toluene solvent case) were observed. Interestingly our results support the fact that for acetic acid, ethanol, and toluene the micro/nanotube formation process is autocatalytic instead of being nucleation-dominating as reported for samples prepared using solvent 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro-2-propanol.},

	abstract = {It has been reported that 58\% of individuals with chronic kidney disease ({CKD}) have moderate to advanced periodontitis due to alterations of {pH} and biochemical composition in the saliva. In fact, the composition of this important biofluid may be modulated by systemic disorders. Here we investigate the micro-reflectance Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy ({FTIR}) spectra of saliva that {CKD} patients submitted to periodontal treatment, aiming to identify spectral biomarkers of kidney disease evolution and the effectiveness of periodontal treatment, proposing possible biomarkers of disease evolution. Saliva from 24 {CKD} patients—stage-5 men, 29 to 64 years old—was evaluated in (i) patients starting periodontal treatment; (ii) patients 30 days after periodontal treatment; and (iii) patients 90 days after periodontal treatment. Our findings indicated that there are statistically relevant changes among the groups after 30 and 90 days of periodontal treatment, when considering the overall spectra in the fingerprint region (800−1800cm
              −1
              ). The key bands presenting good prediction power (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve {\textgreater}0.70) were related to poly ({ADP}-ribose) polymerase ({PARP}) conjugated to {DNA} at 883, 1031, and 1060cm
              −1
              (carbohydrates at 1043 and 1049cm
              −1
              ) and triglycerides (1461cm
              −1
              ). Interestingly when analyzing the derivative spectra in the secondary structure region (1590−1700cm
              −1
              ), we detected over-expression of the
              β
              -sheet class of secondary structures in 90 days of periodontal treatment, possibly related to over-expression of human B-defensins. Conformational changes in ribose sugar in this region corroborate the interpretation concerning {PARP} detection. To our knowledge, {PARP} was detected for the first time in saliva samples of stage-5 {CKD} patients by {FTIR}. All observed changes were correctly interpreted in terms of intensive apoptosis and dyslipidemia due to kidney disease progression. Biomarkers due to {CKD} predominate in saliva, and the relative improvement in the periodontal state did not cause remarkable changes in the spectra of saliva.},

              Objectives
              Electronic nicotine delivery systems (e‐cigarette, pod, and vape) are currently among the tobacco consumption of adolescents and young adults. The aim is to show oral mucosa and saliva alterations related to vape.
            
            
              Material and Methods
              A vape‐user patient, presenting a white plaque in the posterior region of the hard palate, underwent clinical examination, sialometry, {pH} evaluation, and excisional biopsy of the white lesion. Molecular changes in saliva and vape liquid were analyzed by vibrational spectroscopy.
            
            
              Results
              The histopathological analyses showed hyperparakeratosis without dysplasia. Formaldehyde, ketones, and aromatic hydrocarbon species were identified in e‐cig liquid by the {FTIR}.
            
            
              Conclusions
              The use of vape may be related to the development of hyperkeratotic lesions in the oral mucosa as well as significantly modify the patient's salivary patterns as the vape liquid presents carcinogenic and cytotoxic components in its composition.},

Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy ({FTIR}) provides molecular information from optical phenomena observed by the vibration of molecules, being used in biological studies to characterize changes and serving as a form of diagnosis. Aims: this case-control study evaluated the peri-implant disease by using {FTIR} spectroscopy with attenuated total reflectance ({ATR}) in the fingerprint region. Methods: forty saliva samples were evaluated, 18 from the control group and 22 from the peri-implantitis group. Clinical data such as plaque index ({PI}), gingival index ({GI}), probing depth ({PS}) and attachment level ({AL}) were assessed. Results: The results of clinical parameters showed statistical difference between the two groups regarding an excess of the plaque index ({PI}). In the {FTIR}-{ATR} analysis, the main components revealed vibrational modes of fatty acids, histidine, lipid esters, nucleic acids and tryptophan, with the main molecules contributing to spectral discrimination. The five-component {PLS}-{DA} classification model had an accuracy of 81\%, showing differences between healthy and diseased implants. Conclusion: the {FTIR} spectroscopy provides important molecular characteristics of the samples and that the results in association with clinical data show the effectiveness of using this tool for diagnosing the disease.},

	abstract = {Cardiac involvement in 2019 coronavirus disease ({COVID}-19) survivors has been reported frequently. An exacerbated immune response may be the main mechanism of myocardial injury and late cardiac sequelae in this population. Background/Objectives: We investigated the immune profile in hypertensive and non-hypertensive patients with {COVID}-19 who developed late cardiac fibrosis and edema, as detected by magnetic resonance imaging ({MRI}). Methods: We evaluated associations of cytokine and immune-cell subset levels during hospitalization for {COVID}-19 with the presence of myocardial interstitial fibrosis [represented by the extracellular volume ({ECV})] or edema (represented by the T2), detected by cardiac {MRI} examination after discharge, in hypertensive and non-hypertensive patients. Results: Patients with hypertension had reduced B-cell percentages, increased natural killer cell percentages, and higher interleukin ({IL})-4, {IL}-5, {IL}-13, {IL}-17A, and tumor necrosis factor-β levels compared to patients without hypertension. Larger percentages of human leukocyte antigen {DR} isotope+ blood cells, reflecting {CD}8+ T-cell activation, correlated with increased T2 and {ECV} in hypertensive patients. The {HLA}-{DR} mean fluorescence intensity was associated with {ECV} in non-hypertensive patients. Conclusions: Our findings reveal cytokine and immune-cell dysregulation in both hypertensive and non-hypertensive patients with {COVID}-19, along with moderate correlations between {CD}8+ T-cell activation and increased cardiac {MRI} markers of myocardial interstitial fibrosis and edema. These results contribute to a deeper understanding of immune dysfunction mechanisms involved in myocardial remodeling.},

No impact of {CoPP} on heart parasite burden, electrical, or mechanical function was observed during the chronic stage of Colombian-strain infection, despite previous demonstrations of improvement with other antioxidants. Treatment with {CoPP} also did not improve heart function of mice chronically infected with Y-strain.

Estudos recentes revelaram diferenças na {FA} entre vários grupos demográficos, incluindo a população latino-americana.  Objetivos  Melhor compreender as possíveis disparidades na prevalência da {FA} e nas estratégias de tratamento na população brasileira por meio de dados de um registro prospectivo multicêntrico de grande escala.  Métodos  O registro de {FA} da Rede D’Or é um estudo observacional prospectivo multicêntrico que incluiu pacientes com idade ≥ 18 anos com {FA} atendidos no pronto-socorro de 32 hospitais terciários no Brasil. Os pacientes foram caracterizados de acordo com o sexo e outras características basais e classificados de acordo com o uso prévio de anticoagulantes. Foi analisada a falta de uso de anticoagulantes em pacientes com indicações prévias. A significância estatística foi estabelecida em 5\%.  Resultados  Os dados do estudo foram provenientes de um total de 1.955 pacientes inscritos. O sexo masculino foi mais prevalente e os homens eram mais jovens que as mulheres. Devido ao aumento da prevalência de episódios anteriores de {FA} e a um escore {CHA}2DS2-{VASc} mais elevado, mais mulheres tiveram indicação de terapia anticoagulante; no entanto, uma proporção significativa não estava recebendo esse tratamento. Dos 29 óbitos intra-hospitalares, 15 pacientes tinham indicação prévia para anticoagulação, mas apenas 3 estavam em uso de anticoagulantes.  Conclusão  O presente estudo revelou diferenças relacionadas ao sexo na população brasileira de pacientes com {FA} que são consistentes com tendências em países de alta renda. A promoção de uma melhor implementação de terapias anticoagulantes e antitrombóticas para reduzir o risco de óbito e eventos tromboembólicos entre mulheres com {FA} no Brasil é crucial.

            Abstract  Background  Atrial fibrillation ({AF}) is the most prevalent cardiac arrhythmia, and its presentation differs according to age and sex. Recent studies have revealed differences in {AF} among various demographic groups, including the Latin American population.  Objectives  To better understand potential disparities in {AF} prevalence and treatment strategies in the Brazilian population through data from a large multicentric prospective registry.  Methods  The Rede D’Or {AF} registry is a multicenter prospective observational study including patients aged ≥ 18 years with {AF} who were seen in the emergency department of 32 tertiary hospitals in Brazil. Patients were characterized according to sex and other baseline characteristics and were classified according to previous anticoagulant use. The lack of anticoagulant use in patients with previous indications was analyzed. Statistical significance was set at 5\%.  Results  The study data were from a total of 1955 patients enrolled. Male sex was more prevalent, and men were younger than the women. Due to an increased prevalence of previous {AF} episode and a higher {CHA}2DS2-{VASc} score, more women had indications for anticoagulant therapy; however, a significant proportion was not receiving this treatment. From 29 in-hospital deaths, 15 patients had previous indication for anticoagulation, but only 3 were using anticoagulants.  Conclusion  This study revealed sex-related differences in the Brazilian population of patients with {AF} that are consistent with trends in high-income countries. The promotion of better implementation of anticoagulant and antithrombotic therapies to reduce the risk of death and thromboembolic events among women with {AF} in Brazil is crucial.},

              Chemotherapy resistance remains a major cause of therapeutic failure in gastric cancer. The combination of genetic material such as interference {RNAs} ({iRNAs}) to silence cancer-associated genes with chemotherapeutics has become a novel approach for cancer treatment. However, finding the right target genes and developing non-toxic, highly selective nanocarrier systems remains a challenge. Here we developed a novel sialyl-Tn-targeted polylactic acid—didodecyldimethylammonium bromide nanoparticle ({PLA}-{DDAB}) nanoparticles ({NPs}) loaded with {dsRNA} targeting {ST}6GalNac-I and/or galectin-3 genes. Using single photon emission computed tomography ({SPECT}), we have demonstrated that
              99m
              technetium radiolabeled sialyl-Tn-targeted nanoparticles can reach the tumor site and downregulate {ST}6GalNAc-I and galectin-3 {RNA} expression levels when injected intravenously. Furthermore, using an in vivo gastric tumor model, these nanoparticles increased the effectiveness of 5-{FU} in reducing tumor growth. Our findings indicate that cancer-associated glycan-targeted {NPs} loaded with {dsRNA} targeting {ST}6GalNAc-I and/or galectin-3 in combination with standard chemotherapy, have the potential to become a novel therapeutic tool for gastric cancer.},

Neste estudo, foram quantificados os radionuclídeos naturais Ra-226, Ra-228 e K-40 em solos destas áreas utilizando Espectrometria Gama de Alta Resolução. Os resultados serviram para o cálculo valores de índices de risco da radiação: índice gama, índice alfa, dose absorvida, dose efetiva e risco adicional de desenvolvimento de câncer. Foram encontradas concentrações de atividade de Ra-226 e Ra-228 até 3,5 vezes maiores que a média da crosta terrestre, e concentrações de K-40 cerca de 3 vezes menores do que a média. Devido a isso, foram estimados valores de dose absorvida devido à presença destes nuclídeos nos solos até 1,5 vez maiores do que a média mundial, e do risco adicional de desenvolvimento de câncer comparável ao de locais cuja radiação natural de fundo é considerada alta.

Formado a partir do urânio-238 presente no fosforito uranífero que quando exalado para atmosfera pode se acumular em ambientes fechados, representando risco à saúde humana. Este estudo possui o objetivo de analisar o risco de câncer de pulmão associado ao radônio-222 em áreas de ocorrência uranífera localizadas na Região Metropolitana do Recife, {PE}, Brasil. A monitoração do gás na atmosfera das residências foi realizada por meio da exposição de detectores {CR}-39 em câmaras de difusão. As concentrações de radônio indoor encontradas nas residências estudadas variaram de 2 a 1174 Bq m-3, sendo em maior parte superiores aos valores recomendados pela Organização Mundial de Saúde e União Europeia. Pode-se inferir que este estudo em nível local contribui com as estimativas nacionais de incidência de câncer de pulmão, priorizando a proteção da saúde em áreas habitadas de ocorrência uranífera.},

	abstract = {Abstract. Atmospheric lidars can simultaneously measure clouds and aerosols with high temporal and spatial resolution and hence help understand cloud–aerosol interactions, which are the source of major uncertainties in future climate projections. However, atmospheric lidars are typically custom-built, with significant differences between them. In this sense, lidar networks play a crucial role as they coordinate the efforts of different groups, provide guidelines for quality-assured routine measurements and opportunities for side-by-side instrument comparisons, and enforce algorithm validation, all aiming to homogenize the physical retrievals from heterogeneous instruments in a network. Here we provide a high-level overview of the Lidar Processing Pipeline ({LPP}), an ongoing, collaborative, and open-source coordinated effort in Latin America. The {LPP} is a collection of tools with the ultimate goal of handling all the steps of a typical analysis of lidar measurements. The modular and configurable framework is generic enough to be applicable to any lidar instrument. The first publicly released version of the {LPP} produces data files at levels 0 (raw and metadata), 1 (averaging and layer mask), and 2 (aerosol optical properties). We assess the performance of the {LPP} through quantitative and qualitative analyses of simulated and measured elastic lidar signals.
For noiseless synthetic 532 nm elastic signals with a constant lidar ratio ({LR}), the root mean square error ({RMSE}) in aerosol extinction within the boundary layer is about 0.1 \%. In contrast, retrievals of aerosol backscatter from noisy elastic signals with a variable {LR} have an {RMSE} of 11 \%, mostly due to assuming a constant {LR} in the inversion.
The application of the {LPP} for measurements in São Paulo, further constrained by co-located {AERONET} data, retrieved a lidar ratio of 69.9 ± 5.2 sr at 532 nm, in agreement with reported values for urban aerosols. Over the Amazon, analysis of a 6 km thick multi-layer cirrus found a cloud optical depth of about 0.46, also in agreement with previous studies. From this exercise, we identify the need for new features and discuss a roadmap to guide future development, accommodating the needs of our community.},

Firstly, an analysis of the planetary boundary layer height and ventilation coefficient was performed to identify the seasons’ patterns of pollution dispersion. Then, the variations (from 2018 to 2021) of the seasonal average values of air temperature, relative humidity, precipitation, and thermal inversion occurrence/position were compared to identify possible variations in the patterns of such variables that would justify (or deny) the occurrence of more favorable conditions for pollutants dispersion. However, no significant variations were found. Finally, the seasonal average concentrations of the previously mentioned pollutants were compared from 2018 to 2021, and the daily concentrations observed during the pandemic period were compared with a model based on an artificial neural network. Regarding the concentration of pollutants, the primarily sourced from vehicular traffic ({CO} and {NO}2) exhibited substantial variations, demonstrating an inverse relationship with the rate of social distancing. In addition, the measured concentrations deviated from the predictive model during periods of significant social isolation. Conversely, pollutants that were not primarily linked to vehicular sources ({PM}2.5 and {PM}10) exhibited minimal variation from 2018 to 2021; thus, their measured concentration remained consistent with the prediction model.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a study conducted in São Paulo, Brazil, where the planetary boundary layer height ({PBLH}) was determined using ceilometer data and the wavelet covariance transform method. The retrieved {PBLH} values were subsequently compared with the concentrations of {CO}2 and {CH}4 measured at three distinct experimental sites in the city. The period of study was July 2021. This study also included a comparison between ceilometer data and lidar data, which demonstrated the favorable applicability of the ceilometer data for {PBLH} estimation. An examination of the correlation between changes in average {CO}2 concentrations and {PBLH} values revealed stronger correlations for the {IAG} and {UNICID} stations, with correlation coefficients (ρ) of approximately −0.86 and −0.85, respectively, in contrast to the Pico do Jaraguá station, which exhibited a lower correlation coefficient of −0.42. When assessing changes in {CH}4 concentrations against variations in {PBL} height, the retrieved correlation coefficients were approximately −0.78 for {IAG}, −0.66 for {UNICID}, and −0.38 for Pico do Jaraguá. The results indicated that {CO}2/{CH}4 concentrations are negatively correlated with {PBL} heights, with {CO}2 concentrations showing more significant correlation than {CH}4. Additionally, among the three measurement stations, {IAG} measurements displayed the most substantial correlation. The results from this study contribute to the understanding of the relationship between {PBLH} and greenhouse gas concentrations, emphasizing the potential of remote sensing systems like ceilometers in monitoring and studying atmospheric processes.},

	abstract = {Air pollution in the Metropolitan Area of São Paulo ({MASP}), Brazil, is a serious problem and is strongly affected by local sources. However, atmosphere column composition in {MASP} is also affected by biomass burning aerosol ({BB}). Understanding the impacts of aerosol particles, from both vehicles and {BB}, on the air quality and climate depends on in-depth research with knowledge of some parameters such as the optical properties of particles and their chemical composition. This study characterized fine particulate matter ({PM}2.5) from July 2019 to August 2020 in the eastern part of the {MASP}, relating the chemical composition data obtained at the surface and columnar optical parameters, such as aerosol optical depth ({AOD}), Ångström Exponent ({AE}), and single-scattering albedo ({SSA}). According to the analyzed data, the mean {PM}2.5 concentration was 18.0 ± 12.5 µg/m3; however, daily events exceeded 75 times the air quality standard of the World Health Organization (15 µg/m3). The mean black carbon concentration was 1.8 ± 1.5 µg/m3 in the sampling period. Positive matrix factorization ({PMF}) identified four main sources of aerosol: heavy vehicles (42\%), followed by soil dust plus local sources (38.7\%), light vehicles (9.9\%), and local sources (8.6\%). {AOD} and {AE} presented the highest values in the dry period, during which biomass burning events are more frequent, suggesting smaller particles in the atmosphere. {SSA} values at 440 nm were between 0.86 and 0.94, with lower values in the winter months, indicating the presence of more absorbing aerosol.},

	abstract = {Abstract. Accurate estimation of the wind speed profile is crucial for a range of activities such as wind energy and aviation. The power law and the logarithmic-based profiles have been widely used as universal formulas to extrapolate the wind speed profile. However, these traditional methods have limitations in capturing the complexity of the wind flow, mainly over complex terrain. In recent years, the machine-learning techniques have emerged as a promising tool for estimating the wind speed profiles. In this study, we used the long short-term memory ({LSTM}) recurrent neural network and observational lidar datasets from three different sites over complex terrain to estimate the wind profile up to 230 m. Our results showed that the {LSTM} outperformed the power law as the distance from the surface increased. The coefficient of determination (R2) was greater than 90 \% up to 100 m for input variables up to a 40 m height only. However, the performance of the model improved when the 60 m wind speed was added to the input dataset. Furthermore, we found that the {LSTM} model trained on one site with 40 and 60 m observational data and when applied to other sites also outperformed the power law. Our results show that the machine-learning techniques, particularly {LSTM}, are a promising tool for accurately estimating the wind speed profiles over complex terrain, even for short observational campaigns.},

O modelo matemático, chamado de {FOCAL} usa aproximações da equação de transporte para interpolar os dados medidos e simular medidas realizadas com sistemas de varredura comerciais. O Phantom-Telles foi validado no Real Hospital Português em Recife, por meio de comparação com dados de percentagem de dose profunda ({PDD}) e perfil de campo de radiação de 6 {MV} do acelerador linear {VARIAN}-Truebeam obtidas com um 3D Blue Phantom ({IBA}). Os resultados das medições de {PDD} e perfil de campo mostraram que os dados obtidos com o Phantom-Telles estavam em conformidade com os obtidos com o Blue Phantom, com variações de até 1\% em regiões de alto gradiente de dose, sendo menores que 1\% nas outras regiões. Os resultados indicam que o Phantom-Telles tem potencial para uso em controle de qualidade e comissionamento de aceleradores lineares.},

O rápido crescimento e os altos níveis de consumo de uma sociedade capitalista podem fazer com que as pessoas se distanciem da natureza, levando-as a esquecer o devido cuidado com ela. Ao reconhecer que somos parte da natureza e dependemos dela para nossa sobrevivência e bem-estar, a educação ambiental nos leva a refletir e adotar práticas mais sustentáveis e respeitosas com o meio ambiente, promovendo, assim, um equilíbrio entre desenvolvimento humano e conservação da natureza. Pensando nisso, este trabalho explora o conceito, a aplicação e a utilização de um jardim sensorial desenvolvido a partir de garrafas {PET} em ações no Programa de Residência Pedagógica ({PRP}). O projeto teve como objetivo promover uma sensibilização ambiental de estudantes da educação básica por meio de um jardim sensorial. A estruturação do jardim representou um ambiente que motivou os alunos a se envolverem ativamente na exploração de plantas e no reaproveitamento de materiais, e a compreender que a regeneração do meio ambiente nos leva ao caminho da sustentabilidade. A construção desse espaço, que carrega premissas de sustentabilidade, se configurou como ferramenta didática eficaz para educação ambiental, além de ter apresentado uma relevante etapa na formação docente no {PRP}.},

Para esse uso são necessários cuidados com a proteção radiológica, como pede a Resolução {RDC} nº 611. Neste trabalho são discutidas as principais não conformidades de radioproteção observadas em estabelecimentos de radiologia veterinária de Aracaju, {SE}, a partir de dados obtidos em inspeção da Vigilância Sanitária Municipal ocorrida em 2023. Nesta cidade, os tais serviços não eram inspecionados há 10 anos. Dentre as não conformidades, foi identificado o não uso de vestimentas de proteção radiológica ({VPR}) e de dosímetros pessoais pelos profissionais. Em revisão bibliográfica, observou-se que alguns desses problemas são recorrentes em outras cidades e países. Buscando-se entender sobre a formação desses profissionais, foram analisadas as ementas das disciplinas de um dos cursos de Medicina Veterinária ofertado em Aracaju, constatando-se a ausência do tema proteção radiológica no seu teor. Dessa forma, a falta de conhecimentos sobre proteção radiológica identificada a partir das práticas desses profissionais formados pode ser justificada. Portanto, ações promotoras de formação sobre práticas de proteção radiológica e inspeções sanitárias mais frequentes se fazem necessárias para conscientizar médicos veterinários acerca da segurança radiológica, e para manter os estabelecimentos veterinários em conformidade com as diretrizes de organização e adequado funcionamento de serviços de radiologia diagnóstica.},

              This study evaluates the influence of the method used to calculate the effective atomic number (Z

              ) on the estimate of secondary radiation yielded under kilovoltage x-ray beams by metal alloys with a wide range of biomedical applications. Two methods for calculating Z

              (referred to here as M
              1
              and M
              2

              3
              Sn-Hg (amalgam). The results indicate significant differences in the estimates of fluorescence yield depending on the method used to estimate Z
              eff
              for each metallic alloy. Both the choice of the calculation method for Z
              eff
              and the energy ranges of the incident radiation are essential factors affecting the behavior of alloys in terms of fluorescence production. Our results may guide the selection of the best material for a biomedical application. The metallic alloys simulated here show equivalences and discrepancies that depend on the method used to estimate Z
              eff
              and the energy range of the incident photons. This finding allows for the creation of combinations of alloys and methods for calculating Z

	abstract = {Diabetes mellitus ({DM}) is a widespread and rapidly growing disease, and it is estimated that it will impact up to 693 million adults by 2045. To cope this challenge, the innovative advances in non-destructive progressive urine glucose-monitoring platforms are important for improving diabetes surveillance technologies. In this study, we aim to better evaluate {DM} by analyzing 149 urine spectral samples (86 diabetes and 63 healthy control male Wistar rats) utilizing attenuated total reflection–Fourier transform infrared ({ATR}-{FTIR}) spectroscopy combined with machine learning ({ML}) methods, including a 3D discriminant analysis approach—3D–Principal Component Analysis–Linear Discriminant Analysis (3D-{PCA}-{LDA})—in the ‘bio-fingerprint’ region of 1800–900 cm−1. The 3D discriminant analysis technique demonstrated superior performance compared to the conventional {PCA}-{LDA} approach with the 3D-{PCA}-{LDA} method achieving 100\% accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. Our results show that this study contributes to the existing methodologies on non-destructive diagnostic methods for {DM} and also highlights the promising potential of {ATR}-{FTIR} spectroscopy with an {ML}-driven 3D-discriminant analysis approach in disease classification and monitoring.},

	abstract = {Breast cancer ({BC}) molecular subtypes diagnosis involves improving clinical uptake by Fourier transform infrared ({FTIR}) spectroscopic imaging, which is a non-destructive and powerful technique, enabling label free extraction of biochemical information towards prognostic stratification and evaluation of cell functionality. However, methods of measurements of samples demand a long time to achieve high quality images, making its clinical use impractical because of the data acquisition speed, poor signal to noise ratio, and deficiency of optimized computational framework procedures. To address those challenges, machine learning ({ML}) tools can facilitate obtaining an accurate classification of {BC} subtypes with high actionability and accuracy. Here, we propose a {ML}-algorithm-based method to distinguish computationally {BC} cell lines. The method is developed by coupling the K-neighbors classifier ({KNN}) with neighborhood components analysis ({NCA}), and hence, the {NCA}-{KNN} method enables to identify {BC} subtypes without increasing model size as well as adding additional computational parameters. By incorporating {FTIR} imaging data, we show that classification accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity improve, respectively, 97.5\%, 96.3\%, and 98.2\%, even at very low co-added scans and short acquisition times. Moreover, a clear distinctive accuracy (up to 9 \%) difference of our proposed method ({NCA}-{KNN}) was obtained in comparison with the second best supervised support vector machine model. Our results suggest a key diagnostic {NCA}-{KNN} method for {BC} subtypes classification that may translate to advancement of its consolidation in subtype-associated therapeutics.},

The effect of red and near-infrared wavelengths on {OM} repair is still misunderstood. The aim of this study was to compare the clinical effect and tissue changes caused by 660 nm and 780 nm exposure in an experimental model of {OM}. Rats were submitted to gamma irradiation for induction of {OM} lesions and treated with 660 nm or 780 nm lasers with the same dosimetry parameters (30 {mW}, 7.5 J/cm2, 10 s, spot size = 0.04 mm, irradiation every two days). Clinical assessment of {OM} severity and histopathological analyses was performed after 8, 14, and 20 days of the ionizing radiation. {OM} severity was reduced in the {PBM} groups, especially when the red laser was used. The histopathological pattern was similar between the {PBM} groups, showing advanced re-epithelization and more pronounced angiogenesis and collagen deposition compared to the control. The 660 nm group showed a greater collagen matrix area than the 780 nm group at 14 days. In conclusion, {PBM} at 660 nm and 780 nm improved the repair of ionizing radiation-induced {OM}. Both wavelengths activated the angiogenesis and collagen deposition, but these tissue effects were more pronounced when 660 nm was used.},

	abstract = {Background/Objectives: Beta-lactam antibiotics, derived from penicillin, are the most used class of antimicrobials used for treating bacterial infections. Over the years, microorganisms have developed resistance mechanisms capable of preventing the effect of these drugs. This condition has been a significant public health concern for the 21st century, especially after predictions that antimicrobial resistance could lead to 10 million deaths annually by 2050. The challenge of developing new antimicrobials brings with it the need to ensure the efficacy of existing ones, hence the importance of developing fast and low-cost monitoring techniques. Methods: In this study, we present an alternative based on nanophotonics using Surface-Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy ({SERS}) mediated by nanoparticles for the detection of antimicrobials, with emphasis on some beta-lactam antibiotics commonly prescribed in cases of critically ill patients. It is a sensitive and accurate technique for drug monitoring, allowing for rapid and specific detection of its molecular signatures. This approach is crucial to address the challenge of antimicrobial resistance and ensure the therapeutic efficacy of existing treatments. Results: Our experiments demonstrate the possibility of identifying spectra with characteristic vibrations (fingerprints) of these antimicrobials via {SERS}. Conclusions: Our results point to new strategies for molecular monitoring of drugs by optical techniques using unconventional nanoparticles.},

Curcumin shows promise as a potential modulator of macrophage polarization, offering a natural strategy for managing inflammation and promoting tissue repair. However, a limiting factor for this beneficial molecule is its limited bioavailability due to its low solubility in water. This study aimed to quantify the effect of curcumin gold nanoparticle ({CurAuNP})-mediated ultrasound irradiation on {THP}-1-derived macrophages as potential therapeutic targets. The photoreduction method was applied to synthesize the gold nanoparticles with curcumin as a ligand ({CurAu}). The effect of adding polyethylene glycol in the synthesis process was studied ({CurAuPEG}). {CurAuNP} characterization included {UV}/Vis, Zeta potential, transmission electron microscopy, and {FTIR}. The amount of singlet oxygen released by curcumin and {CurAuNPs} was quantified by observing 1.3-diphenylisobenzofuran quenching upon ultrasound irradiation (1 {MHz} and 1 W/cm2). The results indicated that ultrasound therapy for 4 min with {CurAuNPs} significantly enhanced singlet oxygen generation and reduced macrophage viability compared to curcumin alone. The increased sonoluminescence and curcumin delivery facilitated by {CurAuNPs} led to greater curcumin activation. Consequently, {CurAuNPs} could offer promising therapeutic options for modulating macrophage polarization in pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory stages.},

              Objective
              . To estimate dose rates delivered by using radioactive
              198
              Au nanoparticles for prostate cancer nanobrachytherapy, identifying contribution by photons and electrons emmited from the source.
              Approach
              . Utilizing
              in silico
              models, two different anatomical representations were compared: a mathematical model and a unstructured mesh model based on the International Commission on Radiological Protection ({ICRP}) Publication 145 phantom. Dose rates by activity were calculated to the tumor and nearby healthy tissues, including healthy prostate tissue, urinary bladder wall and rectum, using Monte Carlo code {MCNP}6.2.
              Main results
              . Results indicate that both models provide dose rate estimates within the same order of magnitude, with the mathematical model overestimating doses to the prostate and bladder by approximately 20\% compared to the unstructured mesh model. The discrepancies for the tumor and rectum were below 4\%. Photons emmited from the source were defined as the primary contributors to dose to other organs, while 97.9\% of the dose to the tumor was due to electrons emmited from the source.
              Significance
              . Our findings emphasize the importance of model selection in dosimetry, particularly the advantages of using realistic anatomical phantoms for accurate dose calculations. The study demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of
              198
              Au nanoparticles in achieving high dose concentrations in tumor regions while minimizing exposure to surrounding healthy tissues. Beta emissions were found to be predominantly responsible for tumor dose delivery, reinforcing the potential of
              198
              Au nanoparticles in localized radiation therapy. We advocate for using realistic body phantoms in further research to enhance reliability in dosimetry for nanobrachytherapy, as the field still lacks dedicated protocols.},

	abstract = {Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma ({HNSCC}) is well known as a serious health problem worldwide, especially in low-income countries or those with limited resources, such as most countries in Latin America. International guidelines cannot always be applied to a population from a large region with specific conditions. This study established a Latin American guideline for care of patients with head and neck cancer and presented evidence of {HNSCC} management considering availability and oncologic benefit. A panel composed of 41 head and neck cancer experts systematically worked according to a modified Delphi process on (1) document compilation of evidence-based answers to different questions contextualized by resource availability and oncologic benefit regarding Latin America (region of limited resources and/or without access to all necessary health care system infrastructure), (2) revision of the answers and the classification of levels of evidence and degrees of recommendations of all recommendations, (3) validation of the consensus through two rounds of online surveys, and (4) manuscript composition. The consensus consists of 12 sections: Head and neck cancer staging, Histopathologic evaluation of head and neck cancer, Head and neck surgery—oral cavity, Clinical oncology—oral cavity, Head and neck surgery—oropharynx, Clinical oncology—oropharynx, Head and neck surgery—larynx, Head and neck surgery—larynx/hypopharynx, Clinical oncology—larynx/hypopharynx, Clinical oncology—recurrent and metastatic head and neck cancer, Head and neck surgery—reconstruction and rehabilitation, and Radiation therapy. The present consensus established 48 recommendations on {HNSCC} patient care considering the availability of resources and focusing on oncologic benefit. These recommendations could also be used to formulate strategies in other regions like Latin America countries.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the impacts of specimen-driven (ex vivo) positive margins on patients with early-stage laryngeal cancer whose tumor bed (defect-driven) margins had been negative. Methods: A retrospective study was performed on 60 consecutive T1b/T2 glottic cancer patients who underwent open frontolateral laryngectomy. The intraoperative margins were obtained from the tumor bed. Their recurrence and disease-free survival were evaluated. In all cases, negative margins were obtained from the surgical bed. The impact of positive margins from the specimen was evaluated in a paraffin study. Results: Among 10 patients with positive margins in the specimen, six experienced local relapse, and among 50 patients with negative margins in the specimen, three developed recurrence. The 5-year disease-free survival rates were 37.5\% and 93.9\%, respectively (p {\textless} 0.001; log-rank). Even with negative margins in the surgical bed, patients with positive margins in the specimen at the final histopathological examination had a 3.5-fold higher chance of developing local recurrence than those with negative margins ({HR} = 13.993; 95\% {CI}: 3.479–56.281; p {\textless} 0.001; univariate Cox regression). Conclusions: Specimen-driven positive margins represent a significant risk factor for local recurrence, even under negative margins at the tumor bed.},

Relato do caso: Em vista da escassez de dados na literatura e da necessidade de maior entendimento sobre o seu diagnóstico, manejo e prognóstico desses pacientes, relata-se o caso de um paciente do sexo masculino, sem infecção pelo {HIV}, com sorologia positiva para {EBV}, diagnosticado com linfoma plasmablástico de mucosa da cavidade oral. O paciente em questão foi tratado de um abscesso periapical há cerca de 30 dias da primeira consulta com pouca melhora, evoluindo com ulceração da mucosa. Por suspeita de carcinoma de mucosa, foi realizada biópsia com diagnóstico de linfoma plasmablástico e iniciado tratamento com esquema quimioterápico {CHOP} (ciclofosfamida, doxorrubicina, vincristina e prednisona). Aproximadamente um mês após início do primeiro ciclo, o paciente foi admitido em sala de emergência com quadro de queda do estado geral, confusão mental, febre e choque séptico por neutropenia febril refratários às medidas de suporte, evoluindo a óbito. Conclusão: A descrição detalhada sobre o linfoma plasmablástico e seu curso clínico faz-se importante ao fornecer informações ao meio científico, considerando a escassez de dados sobre essa doença tão agressiva.},

            {ABSTRACT}  Introduction:  Empathy tends to decline throughout the course of medical training. The relationship between spirituality and empathy has not been widely explored.  Objective:  To correlate empathy and religiosity/spiritualism by means of a voluntary questionnaire applied to medical students and residents.  Methods: This is an exploratory cross-sectional study using an online questionnaire completed on a voluntary basis by medical students and residents, consisting of: socio-demographic data, an empathy questionnaire and questions about religiosity/spiritualism.  Results: From 1,550 invitations, 273 volunteer participants responded (17.6\%). Most were Catholic (103 - 37.7\%), followed by agnostics (84 - 30.8\%), and Protestants and Kardecists (27 - 9.9\% each). The Jefferson Empathy Scale had a mean score of 120.4 (from 90 to 140). Religious belief and degree of empathy did not present any correlation. Neither concept presented significant difference over the course of medical training.  Conclusion: Empathy and religiosity/spiritualism did not present any correlation among medical students and residents.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Papillary thyroid carcinoma ({PTC}) have high node metastasis rates. Occasionally after thyroidectomy, the pathological report reveals node metastasis unintentionally resected. The present study aimed to evaluate the prognosis of these patients. Methods: A retrospective cohort of patients submitted to thyroidectomy with or without central compartment neck dissection ({CCND}) due to {PTC} with a minimum follow-up of five years. Results: A total of 698 patients were included: 320 Nx, 264 {pN}0-incidental, 37 {pN}1a-incidental, 32 {pN}0-{CCND} and 45 {pN}1a-{CCND}. Patients with node metastasis were younger, had larger tumors, higher rates of microscopic extra-thyroidal extension, and angiolymphatic invasion and most received radioiodine therapy. Treatment failure was higher in patients {pN}1a-incidental and {pN}1a-{CCND} (32\% and 16\%, respectively; p {\textless} 0.001—Chi-square test). Disease-free survival ({DFS}) was lower in patients {pN}1a-incidental compared to patients Nx and {pN}0-incidental (p {\textless} 0.001 vs. Nx and {pN}0-incidental and p = 0.005 vs. {pN}0-{CCND}) but similar when compared to patients {pN}1a-{CCND} (p = 0.091)—Log-Rank test. Multivariate analysis demonstrated as independent risk factors: {pT}4a ({HR} = 5.524; 95\%{CI}: 1.380–22.113; p = 0.016), {pN}1a-incidental ({HR} = 3.691; 95\%{CI}: 1.556–8.755; p = 0.003), microscopic extra-thyroidal extension ({HR} = 2.560; 95\%{CI}: 1.303–5.030; p = 0.006) and angiolymphatic invasion ({HR} = 2.240; 95\%{CI}: 1.077–4.510; p = 0.030). Conclusion: Patients that were {pN}1a-incidental were independently associated with lower {DFS}.},

	abstract = {Papillary thyroid carcinoma ({PTC}) is the most common neoplasm of the endocrine system and has an excellent long-term prognosis, with low rates of distant metastatic disease. Although infrequent, there are cases of deaths directly related to {PTC}, especially in patients with metastatic disease, and the factors that could be associated with this unfavorable outcome remain a major challenge in clinical practice. Recently, research into genetic factors associated with {PTC} has gained ground, especially mutations in the {TERT} promoter and {BRAF} gene. However, the role of {microRNAs} remains poorly studied, especially in those patients who have an unfavorable outcome at follow-up. This paper aims to evaluate molecular markers related to the different pathological processes of {PTC}, as well as the histological characteristics of the neoplasm, and to compare this profile with prognosis and death from the disease using an analysis of patients treated for metastatic disease in a single tertiary cancer center. Evaluation of {microRNA} expression in paraffin-embedded tumor specimens was carried out by quantitative {PCR} using the {TaqMan}® Low Density Array ({TLDA}) system. Metastatic patients who died from progression of {PTC} had higher expressions of {miR}-101-3p, {miR}-17-5p, and {miR}-191-5p when compared to patients with stable metastatic disease. These findings are of great importance but should be considered as preliminary because of the small sample.},

However, its significance in oral cancer ({OC}) has not been thoroughly explored. To advance in this field, the present study aimed to investigate the impact of {SIGMAR}1 knockdown in oral cancer cells. To do so, we included in this study our cohort of human {OC} samples and {OC} cell lines, which were utilized for experimental verification through several in vitro assays. Our findings revealed that {SIGMAR}1 overexpression was associated with poor survival rates and positively correlated with {PD}-L1 overexpression in human oral cancer samples. Furthermore, {SIGMAR}1 inhibition led to a decrease in {PD}-L1 expression and sensitized oral cancer cells to cisplatin treatment by enhancing apoptosis. These results suggest that {SIGMAR}1 knockdown may present a promising strategy worthy of further exploration in the management of oral cancer.},

            Introduction The identification of thyroid cancer may be conducted through clinical detection, imaging method, and histopathological examination. Both solitary nodules and multinodular goiter are associated with malignancy.
            Objective To assess the risk factors for malignancy among patients with multinodular goiter submitted to total thyroidectomy.
            Methods A series of 712 consecutive patients, submitted to total thyroidectomy between 2005 and 2016 with multinodular goiter regarding clinical, ultrasound, and pathological variables, was retrospectively evaluated.
            Results There were 408 cases of papillary carcinoma (57.3\%), with the remaining being benign. Gender had no statistical significance (p = 0.169) for malignancy, unlike the Bethesda index, higher age group (p = 0.005), shorter clinical history time (p = 0.036), smaller number of nodules (p {\textless} 0.0001), and smaller nodule size (p {\textless} 0.0001), which were related to malignancy.
            Conclusion The Bethesda index, older age group, shorter clinical history, smaller number of nodules, and smaller size of nodule were related to the diagnosis of papillary carcinoma.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Oral squamous cell carcinoma ({OSCC}) remains a significant public health concern. The variables utilized to determine appropriate treatment for this disease also represent its most unfavorable prognostic factors, with these parameters solely determined by the neoplasm and its behavior. However, a lack of well-established indices is evident in the literature that specifically relate to the patient and indicate a worse prognosis. Objective: To assess the prognostic impact of hematological indices in patients with {OSCC}. Methods: This retrospective cohort study included patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma ({OSCC}) who underwent curative-intent treatment. Treatment encompassed surgery, followed by adjuvant therapy, as necessary. Laboratory tests were conducted immediately prior to surgery, and demographic information was obtained from medical records. Results: The cohort comprised 600 patients, with 73.5\% being male subjects. Adjuvant treatment was recommended for 60.3\% of patients. Throughout the follow-up period, 48.8\% of participants died. Univariate analysis indicated that perineural invasion, angiolymphatic invasion, {pT}4 tumors, lymph node metastases, extranodal extravasation, {RDW} {\textgreater} 14.3\%, {NLR} (neutrophil–lymphocyte ratio) {\textgreater} 3.38, {PLR} (platelet–lymphocyte ratio) {\textgreater} 167.3, and {SII} (systemic inflammatory/immune response index) {\textgreater} 416.1 were factors associated with increased mortality. These threshold values were established through {ROC} curve analysis. In the multivariate analysis, angiolymphatic invasion ({HR} = 1.43; 95\% {CI}: 1.076–1.925; p = 0.014), {pT}4a/b tumors ({HR} = 1.761; 95\% {CI}: 1.327–2.337; p {\textless} 0.001), extranodal extravasation ({HR} = 1.420; 95\% {CI}: 1.047–1.926; p = 0.024), and {RDW} ({HR} = 1.541; 95\% {CI}: 1.153–2.056; p = 0.003) were identified as independent risk factors for decreased overall survival. Conclusions: {RDW} {\textgreater} 14.3\% was proven to be a reliable parameter for assessing overall survival in patients with {OSCC}. Further studies are required to evaluate the clinical applicability of other hematological indices.},

              Background
              Doctors are increasingly faced with end-of-life decisions. Little is known about how medical students approach euthanasia. The objective of this study was to evaluate, among medical students and residents, the view on euthanasia and its variants; correlate such a view with empathy and religiosity/spiritualism; and with the stages of medical training in Brazil.
            
            
              Methods
              This is an exploratory cross-sectional study using an online questionnaire to be filled out on a voluntary basis among medical students and residents, consisting of: socio-demographic data, an empathy questionnaire and questions with elaborate clinical cases that typify situations of the variants of euthanasia.
            
            
              Results
              From 1550 invitations, 273 volunteer participants responded (17.6\%). The percentages of strong agreement/agreement on the concepts were: passive euthanasia (72.9\%); active euthanasia (22.3\%), orthothanasia (90.1\%), dysthanasia (18.7\%), assisted suicide (33\%) and sedation (82.8\%). Passive euthanasia, active euthanasia, dysthanasia and assisted suicide showed greater refusal with increasing length of medical training. Religious belief and degree of empathy did not significantly influence the opinion about the concepts. Strong agreement/agreement were: passive euthanasia (72.9\%); active euthanasia (22.3\%), orthothanasia (90.1\%), dysthanasia (18.7\%), assisted suicide (33\%) and sedation (82.8\%).
            
            
              Conclusions
              Passive euthanasia, active euthanasia, dysthanasia and assisted suicide showed greater refusal with increasing length of medical training. The external validation of our findings relies on the distinct legal, cultural, and religious frameworks found across various countries.},

The origin of such reflectivity modulation is still a subject of debate. Here, we have used optical coherence tomography ({OCT}) imaging to find whether {iPPG} signals may result from skin optical properties being directly or indirectly modulated by arterial transmural pressure propagation. The light intensity across the tissue was modeled through a simple exponential decay (Beer–Lambert law) to analyze

	abstract = {The increasing use of light-based treatments requires a better understanding of the light tissue interaction for pigmented skin. To enhance comprehension in this area, this study proposes the use of pigmented-mimicking skin phantoms to assess the optical properties based on their tone, represented by the individual typology angle ({ITA}) color scale. In this study, an epoxy resin matrix alongside compact facial powder and titanium dioxide was used to mimic the absorption, scattering, and shade properties of human skins. Eight phantoms covering the skin tones, light ({ITA} = 45.2°), tan ({ITA} = 23.3°), brown ({ITA} = 6.9°, −5.7°, and −16.9°), and dark ({ITA} = –34.6°, −41.6°, and −48.6°), were crafted. The absorption and reduced scattering coefficients were obtained using integrating spheres and calibrated spectrometers in the 500–900 nm range, and tones were measured using a commercial colorimeter. The experimental fitting proposed in this study could estimate the optical properties as a function of the skin tones through {ITA} values, by using an exponential function with a second-order polynomial exponent. This investigation aligns with prior studies involving human skin samples, and these findings hold promise for future clinical and diagnostic applications, particularly in the realm of light-based treatments to individual dermatological corrections in pigmented skin.},

            Abstract Nuclear Medicine plays an important role in the management of patients with chronic diseases, especially oncological and cardiovascular conditions. In this study, an analysis of the evolution of this field in Brazil was conducted within the framework of the Unified Health System. Retrospective analyses from 2015 to 2021 of public data were performed. Although Brazil has a considerable number of facilities, their geographical distribution is uneven. The same disparity is observed in relation to units that produce and distribute radiopharmaceuticals, limiting access for the Brazilian population, particularly to those with a half-life of less than two hours. There is a noticeable high technological dependence on foreign companies, with little or no domestic production, contributing to a deficit in the trade balance. Despite the increasing demands due to factors such as population aging and epidemiological changes, the area did not expand. It is crucial to implement social and economic policies to reduce vulnerabilities in the public healthcare system, ensure its sustainability, and promote equal and universal access to Nuclear Medicine.},

In Brazil, regional disparities in incidences of intermediate and high-risk in late-diagnosed {PC} cases are expected. Objective: To investigate the clinical and demographic profiles of patients treated with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer ({mCRPC}) in Brazil, using real-world data from public databases. Method: Prostate cancer data from the Brazilian cancer registries were filtered from Brazilian public databases from 2008 to 2018. The number of health institutions and registries at a cancer public database were used to separate the Brazilian Federative Units into two comparison groups. {mCRPC} patients were estimated by using a combination of filters of staging and treatment (Tx, Nx and M1 + chemotherapy). The patients’ median age and the number and type of treatments were evaluated. Results: A total of 325,987 patients with prostate cancer and 5,367 patients with {mCRPC} were identified. The median age of the {mCRPC} patients was 63 years. The percentage of patients who underwent one, two or three treatments was 21.0\%, 43.2\% and 28.1\%, respectively. In addition, management differences were noticed depending on the group analyzed. Conclusion: The results revealed regional discrepancies in the distribution of registered {mCRPC} patients in the Brazilian territory and in their treatment. This information can be used to strengthen the recently updated treatment and improve the palliative care offered. This work presents suggestions to improve specific prostate cancer databases.},

The protocol is registered in {PROSPERO} with the number {CRD}42022299726. Methods: A search was conducted in the Embase, Lilacs, Pubmed, Scielo, Web of Science, and clinicaltrials.gov databases, in addition to a manual search in the reference list of relevant articles, for randomized clinical trials and cohort studies. Studies selected were submitted to their own data extraction forms and risk of bias analysis according to the {ROB} 2 and {ROBINS} 1 tools. A meta-analysis was performed, considering the random effect model, calculating the relative risk or the mean difference for dichotomous or continuous data, respectively. The quality of the evidence generated was analyzed by outcome according to the {GRADE} tool. Overall, 46 articles met the inclusion criteria and were included in this systematic review; of these, 4 studies compared {RSL} and {ROLL} with a population of 1550 women, and 43 compared {RSL} and {WGL} with a population of 19,820 women. Results: The results showed that {RSL} is a superior method to {WGL} in terms of surgical efficiency in the impalpable breast lesions’ intraoperative localization, and it is at least equivalent to {ROLL}. Regarding security, {RSL} obtained results equivalent to the already established technique, the {WGL}. In addition to presenting promising results, {RSL} has been proven to be superior to {WGL} and {ROLL} technologies.},

              Background
              We aimed to develop and validate a risk-scoring system for distant metastases ({DMs}) in oral cavity carcinoma ({OCC}).
            
            
              Methods
              Patients with {OCC} who were treated at 4 tertiary cancer institutions with curative surgery with or without postoperative radiation/chemoradiation therapy were randomly assigned to discovery or validation cohorts (3:2 ratio). Cases were staged on the basis of tumor, node, and metastasis staging according to the eighth edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer/Union for International Cancer Control guidelines. Predictors of {DMs} on multivariable analysis in the discovery cohort were used to develop a risk-score model and classify patients into risk groups. The utility of the risk classification was evaluated in the validation cohort.
            
            
              Results
              Overall, 2749 patients were analyzed. Predictors (risk score coefficient) of {DMs} in the discovery cohort were the following: pathological stage (p)T3-4 (0.4), {pN}+ (N1: 0.8; N2: 1.0; N3: 1.5), histologic grade (G) 3 (G3, 0.7), and lymphovascular invasion (0.4). The {DM} risk groups were defined by the sum of the following risk score coefficients: high (\&gt;1.7), intermediate (0.7-1.7), and standard risk (\&lt;0.7). The 5-year {DM} rates (high/intermediate/standard risk groups) were 30\%/15\%/4\% in the discovery cohort (C-index = 0.79) and 35\%/16\%/5\% in the validation cohort, respectively (C-index = 0.77; both P \&lt; .001). In the whole cohort, this predictive model showed excellent discriminative ability in predicting {DMs} without locoregional failure (29\%/11\%/1\%), later (\&gt;2 year) {DMs} (11\%/4\%/2\%), and {DMs} in patients treated with surgery (20\%/12\%/5\%), postoperative radiation therapy (34\%/17\%/4\%), and postoperative chemoradiation therapy (39\%/18\%/7\%) (all P \&lt; .001). The 5-year overall survival rates in the overall cohort were 25\%/51\%/67\% (P \&lt; .001).
            
            
              Conclusions
              Patients at higher risk for {DMs} were identified by use of a predictive-score model for {DMs} that included {pT}3-4, {pN}1/2/3, G3, and lymphovascular invasion. Identified patients may be evaluated for individualized risk-adaptive treatment escalation and/or surveillance strategies.},

Angioleiomyoma frequently occurs on the skin. Due to the lack of smooth muscle in the oral cavity, this tumor is rarely located in the mouth. This study aims to present a rare case of a 36-year-old woman with a painless submucosal nodule in the left cheek mucosa, measuring approximately 2 cm x 1 cm, with 5-years of evolution. Morphological and histochemical examination evidenced the proliferation of smooth muscle around the blood vessels of various calibers. The diagnosis of angioleiomyoma was confirmed, the tumor was surgically removed, and the patient had no further complications after 9-months of follow-up. The diagnosis of oral angioleiomyoma is challenging since this tumor is rare and can mimic or transform into malignancy. For this reason,  histological examination in association with immunohistochemical is invaluable to establishing an accurate diagnosis and delivering suitable treatment.},

	abstract = {Early detection of pre-eclampsia is challenging due to the low sensitivity and specificity of current clinical methods and biomarkers. This study investigates the potential of high-wavenumber {FTIR} spectroscopy (region between 2800 and 3600 cm−1) as an innovative diagnostic approach capable of providing comprehensive biochemical insights with minimal sample preparation. Blood samples were collected from 33 pregnant women and their corresponding 33 newborns during induction or spontaneous labor. By analyzing the dried blood plasma samples, we identified biomarkers associated with {FTIR} vibrational modes, including 2853.6 cm−1 ({CH}2 stretching in lipids), 2873.0 cm−1 ({CH}3 stretching in lipids and proteins), and 3279.7 cm−1 (O–H stretching related to water and proteins). Machine learning classification revealed 76.3\% ± 3.5\% sensitivity and 56.1\% ± 4.4\% specificity in distinguishing between pre-eclamptic and non-pre-eclamptic pregnant women, along with 79.0\% ± 3.5\% sensitivity and 76.9\% ± 6.2\% specificity for newborns. The overall accuracy for classifying all pregnant women and newborns was 71.8\% ± 2.5\%. The results indicate that high-wavenumber {FTIR} spectroscopy can enhance classification performance when combined with other analytical methods. Our findings suggest that investigating hydrophilic sites may complement plasma analysis in clinical settings.},

	abstract = {In recent years, the disease burden of hyperuricemia has been increasing, especially in high-income countries and the economically developing world with a Western lifestyle. Abnormal levels of uric acid and hypoxanthine are associated with many diseases, and therefore, to demonstrate improved methods of uric acid and hypoxanthine detection, three different bodily fluids were analysed using surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy ({SERS}) and high-performance liquid chromatography ({HPLC}). Gold nanostar suspensions were mixed with series dilutions of uric acid and hypoxanthine, 3 {kDa} centrifugally filtered human blood serum, urine and saliva. The results show that gold nanostars enable the quantitative detection of the concentration of uric acid and hypoxanthine in the range 5–50 μg/{mL} and 50–250 ng/{mL}, respectively. The peak areas of {HPLC} and maximum peak intensity of {SERS} have strongly correlated, notably with the peaks of uric acid and hypoxanthine at 1000 and 640 cm−1, respectively. The r2 is 0.975 and 0.959 for uric acid and hypoxanthine, respectively. Each of the three body fluids has a number of spectral features in common with uric acid and hypoxanthine. The large overlap of the spectral bands of the {SERS} of uric acid against three body fluids at spectra peaks were at 442, 712, 802, 1000, 1086, 1206, 1343, 1436 and 1560 cm−1. The features at 560, 640, 803, 1206, 1290 and 1620 cm−1 from hypoxanthine were common to serum, saliva and urine. There is no statistical difference between {HPLC} and {SERS} for determination of the concentration of uric acid and hypoxanthine (p {\textgreater} 0.05). For clinical applications, 3 {kDa} centrifugal filtration followed by {SERS} can be used for uric acid and hypoxanthine screening is, which can be used to reveal the subtle abnormalities enhancing the great potential of vibrational spectroscopy as an analytical tool. Our work supports the hypnosis that it is possible to obtain the specific concentration of uric acid and hypoxanthine by comparing the {SER} signals of serum, saliva and urine. In the future, the analysis of other biofluids can be employed to detect biomarkers for the diagnosis of systemic pathologies.},

	abstract = {Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease, and its spread involves a succession of clinical and pathological stages. Screening is predominantly based on mammography, which has critical limitations related to the effectiveness and production of false-positive or false-negative results, generating discomfort and low adherence. In this context, infrared with attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared ({ATR} {FT}-{IR}) spectroscopy emerges as a non-destructive sample tool, which is non-invasive, label-free, has a low operating-cost, and requires only a small amount of sample, including liquid plasma samples. We sought to evaluate the clinical applicability of {ATR} {FT}-{IR} in breast cancer screening. {ATR} {FT}-{IR} spectroscopy through its highest potential spectral biomarker could distinguish, by liquid plasma biopsy, breast cancer patients and healthy controls, obtaining a sensitivity of 97\%, specificity of 93\%, a receiver operating characteristic {ROC} curve of 97\%, and a prediction accuracy of 94\%. The main variance between the groups was mainly in the band 1511 cm

	abstract = {Background/Aims:Nitric oxide ({NO}) plays a dual role, acting as both an oxidant and a reducer, with various effects depending on its concentration and environment. Acute kidney injury’s ({AKI}) pathogenesis observed in cardiorenal syndrome 3 ({CRS} 3) involves inflammatory responses and the production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species. However, the role of {NO} on the development of {CRS} 3 is still not completely understood. The study aimed to mimic {CRS} 3 in vitro and investigate {NO} signaling and inflammatory molecules. Methods:Thus, {HEK}293 cells were submitted to normoxia ({NX}) or hypoxia ({HX}) protocols for 16 h followed by 3 h of reoxygenation, treated or not with L -{NAME}. Conditionate medium by {HEK}293 was transferred to H9c2 for 24 h. Cellular viability was evaluated by {MTT} assay, real time {PCR} was used to analyze gene expression and {NO} content were evaluated in the intra and extracellular medium by amperimetry. Results:Carbonic anhydrase 9 ({CA}9) expression increased 2.9-fold after hypoxia. Hypoxia reduced 18 \% cell viability in {HEK}293 that was restored by L -{NAME} treatment. The sum of nitrite ({NO}2-) and S-nitrosothiol (S-{NO}) fractions in {HEK}293 cells showed a substantial decrease on {NO} intracellular content (38 \%). Both {IL}-6 and {IL}-10 decreased in all groups compared to {NX} cells. Besides {TNF}-α and Bax/Bcl2 ratio increased in hypoxia (approximately 120-fold and 600-fold, respectively) and L -{NAME} restored this effect. Regarding H9c2 cells, the S-{NO} fractions showed a substantial decrease in extracellular content after {HX} (17\%) that was not restored by L -{NAME}. {IL}-1β decreases in cardiac cells treated with conditioned medium from {HX}/L-{NAME}. Conclusion:In conclusion this study highlights the complex interplay of {NO} and inflammatory factors in hypoxia-induced renal and cardiac cell responses, with potential implications for cardiorenal syndrome.},

The immune system is involved in modulating the severity of kidney injury, and the role of immune system cells in the development of {CRS} 3 is not well established. The present work aims to characterize the macrophage and T and B lymphocyte populations in kidney and heart tissue after {AKI} induced by renal I/R. Thus, C57BL/6 mice were subjected to a renal I/R protocol by occlusion of the left renal pedicle (unilateral) for 60 min, followed by reperfusion for 3, 8 and 15 days. The immune cell populations of interest were identified using flow cytometry, and {RT}-{qPCR} was used to evaluate gene expression. As a result, a significant increase in {TCD}4+, {TCD}8+ lymphocytes and M1 macrophages to the renal tissue was observed, while B cells in the heart decreased. A renal tissue repair response characterized by Foxp3 activation predominated. However, a more inflammatory profile was shown in the heart tissue influenced by {IL}-17RA and {IL}-1β. In conclusion, the {AKI} generated by renal I/R was able to activate and recruit T and B lymphocytes and macrophages, as well as pro-inflammatory mediators to renal and cardiac tissue, showing the role of the immune system as a bridge between both organs in the context of {CRS} 3.},

The 20 mg/L dose of {PCS} led to a decrease in renal mass, an increase in the gene expression of Cystatin C and kidney injury molecule 1 ({KIM}-1), and a decrease in the α-actin in the heart. During {AKI}, {PCS} increased the renal injury biomarkers compared to control; however, it did not exacerbate these markers. Furthermore, {PCS} did not enhance the cardiac hypertrophy observed after 15 days of {IR}. An increase, but not potentialized, in the cardiac levels of interleukin ({IL})-1β and {IL}-6 in the {IR} group treated with {PCS}, as well as in the injured kidney, was also noticed. In short, {PCS} administration did not intensify kidney injury, inflammation, and cardiac outcomes after {AKI}.},

	abstract = {A instalação de aparelhos ortodônticos fixos é um fator determinante para o acúmulo de biofilme na cavidade oral. A falta de controle adequado do biofilme nesses casos contribui para a modificação da composição do biofilme, favorecendo ao aparecimento de manifestações inflamatórias do tecido gengival, culminando no aumento gengival. Esta manifestação pode se tornar crônica uma vez que os tecidos gengivais aumentados se tornam um obstáculo aos procedimentos de controle do biofilme, gerando desconforto e insatisfação aos pacientes. Nesse contexto, o objetivo deste artigo é relatar um caso clínico de excisão cirúrgica de aumento gengival em paciente ortodôntico por meio da utilização do laser de alta potência. Paciente do sexo masculino, 18 anos de idade, melanoderma e portador de púrpura foi encaminhado por sua ortodontista para correção do aumento gengival. Diante do quadro apresentado foi planejada a terapia básica periodontal seguida de excisão cirúrgica do tecido gengival aumentado por meio do laser de alta potência de diodo. Após os procedimentos iniciais relacionados ao controle do biofilme foram executados dois tempos cirúrgicos seguidos de reforço das instruções de higiene oral. Considerando o estado sistêmico geral do paciente, concluímos que a excisão dos tecidos gengivais com o laser de alta potência possibilitou um procedimento confortável, proporcionando menor sangramento no trans e pós cirúrgico, resultando num padrão adequado de cicatrização.

            The installation of fixed orthodontic appliances is a determining factor for the accumulation of biofilm in the oral cavity. The lack of adequate biofilm control in these cases contributes to the modification of the biofilm composition, favoring the appearance of inflammatory manifestations of the gingival tissue, culminating in gingival enlargement. This manifestation can become chronic as the enlarged gingival tissues become an obstacle to biofilm control procedures, generating discomfort and dissatisfaction for patients. In this context, the objective of this article is to report a clinical case of surgical excision of gingival enlargement in an orthodontic patient using a high-power laser. An 18-year-old male patient, melanoderm with purpura was referred by his orthodontist for correction of gingival enlargement. Given the situation presented, basic periodontal therapy was planned followed by surgical excision of the enlarged gingival tissue using a high-power diode laser. After the initial procedures related to biofilm control, two surgical procedures were performed followed by reinforcement of oral hygiene instructions. Considering the patient's general systemic status, we concluded that the excision of the gingival tissues with the high-power laser enabled a comfortable procedure, providing less bleeding during and after surgery, resulting in an adequate standard of healing.},

	abstract = {A osteorradionecrose é caracterizada como uma complicação debilitante que pode ocorrer em pacientes submetidos à radioterapia para o tratamento de câncer de cabeça e pescoço. Nesta condição, o osso maxilar ou mandibular fica enfraquecido em razão de uma alta dose de radiação, fazendo com que haja perda de integridade da pele e mucosa, expondo o osso e persistindo sem cicatrização por no mínimo três meses. Alguns dos fatores que podem desencadear a osteorradionecrose são extrações dentárias, doença periodontal, cáries, abscessos e a alta dose de radiação empregada. Os sintomas normalmente apresentados incluem dor, odor, trismo, disestesia e fístula. Com relação ao tratamento, a abordagem conservadora é indicada nos casos iniciais e de pequenas lesões. Já as lesões extensas e de longa data necessitam de um manejo cirúrgico como, por exemplo, o debridamento, a ressecção e a hemimandibulectomia. Tratando-se de reconstrução mandibular, os retalhos preconizados para a cirurgia são o de fíbula, crista ilíaca, escápula e radial do antebraço. Estes retalhos apresentam características eficazes para a devolução de função e estética ao paciente. Este consiste em uma revisão dos artigos sobre o tema, buscados na base Pubmed e Google Acadêmico com o objetivo de detalhar acerca da osteorradionecrose e enfatizar o seu tratamento cirúrgico.

            Osteoradionecrosis is characterized as a debilitating complication that can occur in patients undergoing radiotherapy for the treatment of head and neck cancer. In this condition, the maxillary or mandibular bone is weakened on account of a high dose of radiation, causing loss of integrity of the skin and mucosa, exposing the bone and persisting without healing for at least three months. Some of the factors that may trigger osteoradionecrosis are tooth extractions, periodontal disease, dental caries, abscesses and the high dose of radiation used. Usual symptoms include pain, odor, trismus, dysesthesia and fistula. Regarding the treatment, the conservative approach is indicated in initial cases and in cases of small lesions. Extensive and long-standing lesions require surgical management, such as, for example, debridement, resection and hemimandibulectomy. In the matter of mandibular reconstruction, the recommended flaps for surgery are the fibula, iliac crest, scapula and forearm radial. These flaps have effective characteristics for restoring function and aesthetics to the patient. This consists on a review of articles on the subject, searched in Pubmed and Google Scholar databases, with the purpose of detailing osteoradionecrosis and emphasizing its surgical treatment.},

	abstract = {Radioactive thin films have a direct application in the development of beta-voltaic batteries. The main advantage of that kind of nuclear battery is its durability, which can range from a hundred years, depending on the half-life of the radioisotope used. In this context, Pulsed Laser Deposition ({PLD}) is an important tool. A relevant aspect of a system using this technique is that the main equipment is outside the chamber where the material is processed. Consequently, this feature allows the growth of radioactive thin films, as it enables the development of an arrangement where the contaminated area is controlled. In this way, the present work proposed the development of a {PLD} system for the growth of radioactive thin films. The {PLD} system was then implemented and radioactive copper targets were processed for 60 min and 120 min, resulting in radioactive thin films with an average thickness of (167.8 ± 3.7) nm and (313.5 ± 9.2) nm, respectively. Then, a study was performed about the radioactive contamination spread in the {PLD} system in order to prove if the filtering implemented was effective in retaining the contamination inside the vacuum chamber. Thus, it is demonstrated for the first time the feasibility of using the {PLD} technique in the growth of radioactive thin films, making its use possible in future studies on the development of beta-voltaic nuclear batteries.},

The aims of the present paper were to propose a methodology to measure nanoparticle size and present the estimation of the particle size uncertainty using the dynamic light scattering technique. The reliability of measurements was ensured by a series of handling precautions and quality criteria for good measurements to be applied for methodology validation using reference material polyvinylpyrrolidone coated silver nanoparticles. The identification and quantification of input quantities to the measurement uncertainties were estimated. The uncertainty concerning the equipment was 1.2\% while the repeatability obtained was 1.4\%, within the range of values stipulated in the reference standard (less than 5\%). The relative standard uncertainties of trueness and repeatability were below the thresholds defined by the International Organization for Standardization. The result of the expanded uncertainty was 3.9\% with 95\% coverage probability for the reference material.},

We have used two complementary approaches to study scientific collaboration. At first, structural equation modeling with partial least squares was used to evaluate and test a conceptual model based on personal, behavioral, cultural and circumstantial factors to identify which of these factors best explain the propensity of authors of technical and scientific publications to establish collaboration links with each other. The first part produced a second order latent variable named “propensity to collaborate”. In the second part, we evaluate if and how this propensity to collaborate is reflected in the structural position of these authors in the R\&D coauthorship network of our case study, . The findings showed that the proposed factors moderately explain the authors' collaboration propensity in a R\&D environment. Although the model has not been satisfactory to explain the authors' structural position in the coauthorship network,  however, it was a starting point to study scientific collaboration using structural equation modeling and social network analysis.},

            {ABSTRACT}
            
              Antimicrobial blue light ({aBL}) offers efficacy and safety in treating infections. However, the bacterial targets for {aBL} are still poorly understood and may be dependent on bacterial species. Here, we investigated the biological targets of bacterial killing by {aBL} (λ = 410 nm) on three pathogens:
              Staphylococcus aureus
              ,
              Escherichia coli
              , and
              Pseudomonas aeruginosa
              . Initially, we evaluated the killing kinetics of bacteria exposed to {aBL} and used this information to calculate the lethal doses ({LD}) responsible for killing 90 and 99.9\% of bacteria. We also quantified endogenous porphyrins and assessed their spatial distribution. We then quantified and suppressed reactive oxygen species ({ROS}) production in bacteria to investigate their role in bacterial killing by {aBL}. We also assessed {aBL}-induced {DNA} damage, protein carbonylation, lipid peroxidation, and membrane permeability in bacteria. Our data showed that
              P. aeruginosa
              was more susceptible to {aBL} ({LD}
              99.9
              = 54.7 J/cm
              2
              ) relative to
              S. aureus
              ({LD}
              99.9
              = 158.9 J/cm
              2
              ) and
              E. coli
              ({LD}
              99.9
              = 195 J/cm
              2
              ).
              P. aeruginosa
              exhibited the highest concentration of endogenous porphyrins and level of {ROS} production relative to the other species. However, unlike other species, {DNA} degradation was not observed in
              P. aeruginosa
              . Sublethal doses of blue light ({\textless}{LD}
              90
              ) could damage the cell membrane in Gram-negative species but not in
              S. aureus
              . In all bacteria, oxidative damage to bacterial {DNA} (except
              P. aeruginosa
              ), proteins, and lipids occurred after high {aBL} exposures ({\textgreater}{LD}
              99.9
              ). We conclude that the primary targets of {aBL} depend on the species, which are probably driven by variable antioxidant and {DNA}-repair mechanisms.
            
            
              {IMPORTANCE}
              Antimicrobial-drug development is facing increased scrutiny following the worldwide antibiotic crisis. Scientists across the world have recognized the urgent need for new antimicrobial therapies. In this sense, antimicrobial blue light ({aBL}) is a promising option due to its antimicrobial properties. Although {aBL} can damage different cell structures, the targets responsible for bacterial inactivation have still not been completely established and require further exploration. In our study, we conducted a thorough investigation to identify the possible {aBL} targets and gain insights into the bactericidal effects of {aBL} on three relevant pathogens:
              Staphylococcus aureus
              ,
              Escherichia coli
              , and
              Pseudomonas aeruginosa
              . This research not only adds new content to blue light studies but opens new perspectives to antimicrobial applications.},

            Combining metallic additive manufacturing with laser texturing could be an alternative in obtaining parts with functional hydrophilic surfaces, which improves osteointegration. Careful study of the corrosion behavior of the surfaces obtained is necessary, because the evolution of this phenomenon can influence the osteointegration of the implant, causing the release of metal ions in the body and even the rejection of the component. This study compared the corrosion behavior of laser texturing Ti6Al4V components with components manufactured using laser power bed fusion of the same alloy followed by laser texturing. Their microstructure, roughness, wettability, and electrochemical behavior were analyzed, and different morphologies and microtopographies were observed comparing both samples. The electrochemical tests obtained indicate that Ti6Al4V showed higher corrosion resistance than L-{PBF} Ti6Al4V after laser texturing. The results suggest that laser texturing can encourage cell proliferation and osseointegration on the surface of Ti6Al4V biomedical implants.},

The thermal diffusion depth is negligible when compared with the optical penetration depth because laser-matter interaction occurs only near the focal volume. Hence, ultrashort pulse lasers are indicated for micromachining. This study aims to evaluate straight and zig-zag texture patterns generated by ultrashort laser pulses on the rake face of uncoated cemented carbide tools during the turning of martensitic stainless steel. The tests were performed under dry and lubricated conditions. The output variables were machining force, cutting power, chip thickness ratio and aspects of workpiece quality (form tolerance and surface roughness). The textures presented micrometric dimensions with a narrow deviation. The main results showed that the straight texture pattern decreased the machining force by 17.5\% when compared to the zig-zag pattern. For cutting power, the straight pattern reduced consumption by 5.8\% and 6.9\% in relation to the reference and zig-zag tools, respectively. Finally, under dry machining conditions, the straight tool was able to decrease the workpiece cylindricity deviation by an average of 108\% and 25\% compared to the reference and zig-zag tools. The results provide evidence that texturing can affect the tribological system, chip-tool interface, with a potential impact on the sustainability of the process.},

Enhanced guidance was observed with a larger radius of curvature (80 mm) among the two distinct S-bend waveguides produced. The maximum relative propagation loss was recorded for the S-bend waveguide with a 40 mm radius, while the minimum loss was noted for the Y-shaped waveguide. In the latter configuration, with an opening angle of 5° and a separation of 300 µm between the two arms, an output power ratio of 50.5/49.5 between the left and right arms indicated promising potential for beam splitter applications. During the study, the quality factor (M2) of the proposed architectures was measured and the 80 mm S-bend configuration presented the best symmetry between the x and y axes; in the case of the Y configuration the similarity between the M2 values in both axes, for the first and second arms, indicates comparable light guidance.},

due to its useful properties, disposal, competitive price, and wide technological applicability.
This work aims to produce alumina crucibles with controlled size and shape from free dispensant

	abstract = {Background:
              Ceria ({CeO}2) belongs to rare-earth series and due to its profitable
properties, presents a wide commercial use such as catalysis, energy, biological,
biomedical, and pharmaceutical. The features of the starting materials in the form of
free powders influence notably the processing, formation, as well as characteristics of
the final structures{\textbackslash}bodies obtained by colloidal processing. This study aims to characterize
{CeO}2 powders. The results obtained are worthwhile data to advance toward new
rare-earth based materials for radiation dosimetry.
            
            
              Methods:
              {CeO}2 powders were evaluated by the following techniques: {PCS}, {SEM}, {XRD},
{FT}-{IR}, {EPR}, {IPC}, and pycnometric density (ρ). The stability of particles in aqueous solvent
was evaluated by zeta potential (ζ) determination.
            
            
              Results:
              {CeO}2 powders exhibited cubic C-type form, Fm-3m space group, a mean particle
size (d50) of 19.3nm, and a pycnometric density (ρ) of 7.01g.cm-3. Based on the results
of zeta potential determination, {CeO}2 powders exhibited high stability at {pH} 6.4 with ζ-
value of {\textbar}34.0{\textbar}{mV}.
            
            
              Conclusion:
              The evaluation of {CeO}2 powders was reported. The results presented and
discussed in this study contribute to advance in the search of new rare-earth based materials
for radiation dosimetry.},

Sample preparation involved the melt-quenching method, employing adequate heat treatment to facilitate Ag {NC} formation. Absorption spectroscopy confirmed trivalent rare-earth ion incorporation. Ag {NC} identification and the amorphous structure were observed using transmission electron microscopy. A tunable visible emission from blue to the yellow region was observed. The energy transfer mechanism from Ag {NCs} to Tm3+ ions was demonstrated by enhanced 800 nm emission under 380 and 400 nm excitations, mainly for samples with a higher concentration of Ag {NCs}; moreover, the long lifetime decrease of Ag {NCs} at 600 nm (excited at 380 and 400 nm) and the lifetime increase of Tm3+ ions at 800 nm (excitation of 405 nm) corroborated the energy transfer between those species. Therefore, we attribute this energy transfer mechanism to the decay processes from S1→T1 and T1→S0 levels of Ag {NCs} to the 3H4 level of Tm3+ ions serving as the primary path of energy transfer in this system. {GeO}2-{PbO} glasses demonstrated potential as materials to host Ag {NCs} with applications for photonics as solar cell coatings, wideband light sources, and continuous-wave tunable lasers in the visible spectrum, among others.},

	abstract = {This work investigates the optical properties of Yb3+ ions doped {GeO}2-{PbO} glasses containing Ag nanoclusters ({NCs}), produced by the melt-quenching technique. The lack in the literature regarding the energy transfer ({ET}) between these species in these glasses motivated the present work. Tunable visible emission occurs from blue to orange depending on the Yb3+ concentration which affects the size of the Ag {NCs}, as observed by transmission electron microscopy. The {ET} mechanism from Ag {NCs} to Yb3+ ions (2F7/2 → 2F5/2) was attributed to the S1→T1 decay (spin-forbidden electronic transition between singlet–triplet states) and was corroborated by fast and slow lifetime decrease (at 550 nm) of Ag {NCs} and photoluminescence ({PL}) growth at 980 nm, for excitations at 355 and 405 nm. The sample with the highest Yb3+ concentration exhibits the highest {PL} growth under 355 nm excitation, whereas at 410 nm it is the sample with the lowest concentration. The restriction of Yb3+ ions to the growth of {NCs} is responsible for these effects. Thus, higher Yb3+ concentration forms smaller Ag {NCs}, whose excitation at 355 nm leads to more efficient {ET} to Yb3+ ions compared to 410 nm. These findings have potential applications in the visible to near-infrared regions, such as tunable {CW} laser sources and photovoltaic devices.},

	abstract = {When considering dynamically stable resonators, ring lasers are good choices because they have a stability interval that is twice as large as that of linear resonators and sensitivity to misalignment decreasing with pump power; however, the literature does not provide easy design guidelines. A ring resonator utilizing Nd:{YAG} side pumped by diodes allowed single-frequency operation. The output single-frequency laser had good output characteristics; however, the overall length of the resonator did not allow for building a compact device with low misalignment sensitivity and larger spacing between longitudinal modes which could improve single-frequency performance. Based on previously developed equations, which allow for ease of design of a ring dynamically stable resonator, we discuss how to build an equivalent ring resonator, aiming to building a shorter resonator with the same stability zone parameters. The study of the symmetric resonator containing a pair of lenses allowed us to find the conditions to build the shortest possible resonator.},

              The Atlantic Forest is one of the richest regions in biodiversity in the world. Originally the biome covered around 15\% of the Brazilian territory. Currently, there are approximately 12.4\% of forest remnants preserved in the country. Regarding mangrove areas in the state of São Paulo, there are around 223 km
              2
              according to the Brazilian Mangrove Atlas, with around 120.5 km
              2
              located in Baixada Santista. Analysis of sediments found in the estuarine mangroves of Santos shows a high concentration of microplastics ({MPs}), generated by industrial processes and human activity, that constitutes today one of the main environmental problems. The {MPs} presented in the sediment samples are quantified using a methodology that involves drying, sieving, quantification, and identification of these {MPs} through {FTIR} and micro‐Raman spectroscopy. The two techniques complement each other to identify {MP} filaments and fragments through common polymer spectra. Furthermore, the micro‐Raman technique also identified additives flexo blue (blue ink) and neolan green 8G (dye) in {MPs}. All identified polymers ({\textless} 5 mm) have wide applications and demands in various sectors, including packaging, construction, automotive, electronics, and textiles.},

	abstract = {The emergence of drug resistance in cutaneous leishmaniasis ({CL}) has become a major problem over the past decades. The spread of resistant phenotypes has been attributed to the wide misuse of current antileishmanial chemotherapy, which is a serious threat to global health. Photodynamic therapy ({PDT}) has been shown to be effective against a wide spectrum of drug-resistant pathogens. Due to its multi-target approach and immediate effects, it may be an attractive strategy for treatment of drug-resistant
              Leishmania
              species. In this study, we sought to evaluate the activity of {PDT}
              in vitro

              Leishmania amazonensis
              strains: the wild-type ({WT}) and a lab induced miltefosine-resistant ({MFR}) strain. The underlying mechanisms of {DMMB}-{PDT} action upon the parasites was focused on the changes in the lipid metabolism of both strains, which was conducted by a quantitative lipidomics analysis. We also assessed the production of {ROS}, mitochondrial labeling and lipid droplets accumulation after {DMMB}-{PDT}. Our results show that {DMMB}-{PDT} produced high levels of {ROS}, promoting mitochondrial membrane depolarization due to the loss of membrane potential. In addition, both untreated strains revealed some differences in the lipid content, in which {MFR} parasites showed increased levels of phosphatidylcholine, hence suggesting this could also be related to their mechanism of resistance to miltefosine. Moreover, the oxidative stress and consequent lipid peroxidation led to significant phospholipid alterations, thereby resulting in cellular dysfunction and parasite death. Thus, our results demonstrated that {DMMB}-mediated {PDT} is effective to kill

	abstract = {Melanoma is a serious and aggressive type of skin cancer with growing incidence, and it is the leading cause of death among those affected by this disease. Although surgical resection has been employed as a first-line treatment for the early stages of the tumor, noninvasive topical treatments might represent an alternative option. However, they can be irritating to the skin and result in undesirable side effects. In this context, the potential of topical polymeric hydrogels has been investigated for biomedical applications to overcome current limitations. Due to their biocompatible properties, hydrogels have been considered ideal candidates to improve local therapy and promote wound repair. Moreover, drug combinations incorporated into the polymeric-based matrix have emerged as a promising approach to improve the efficacy of cancer therapy, making them suitable vehicles for drug delivery. In this work, we demonstrate the synthesis and characterization of Pluronic F-127 hydrogels ({PL}) containing the nitric oxide donor S-nitrosoglutathione ({GSNO}) and copper oxide nanoparticles ({CuO} {NPs}) against melanoma cells. Individually applied {NO} donor or metallic oxide nanoparticles have been widely explored against various types of cancer with encouraging results. This is the first report to assess the potential and possible underlying mechanisms of action of {PL} containing both {NO} donor and {CuO} {NPs} toward cancer cells. We found that {PL} + {GSNO} + {CuO} {NPs} significantly reduced cell viability and greatly increased the levels of reactive oxygen species. In addition, this novel platform had a huge impact on different organelles, thus triggering cell death by inducing nuclear changes, a loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, and lipid peroxidation. Thus, {GSNO} and {CuO} {NPs} incorporated into {PL} hydrogels might find important applications in the treatment of skin cancer.},
