abstract: > 
  Cardiorenal syndrome type 3 (CRS 3) occurs when there is an acute kidney injury (AKI) leading to the development of an acute cardiac injury. The immune system is involved in modulating the severity of kidney injury, and the role of immune system cells in the development of CRS 3 is not well established. The present work aims to characterize the macrophage and T and B lymphocyte populations in kidney and heart tissue after AKI induced by renal I/R. Thus, C57BL/6 mice were subjected to a renal I/R protocol by occlusion of the left renal pedicle (unilateral) for 60 min, followed by reperfusion for 3, 8 and 15 days. The immune cell populations of interest were identified using flow cytometry, and RT-qPCR was used to evaluate gene expression. As a result, a significant increase in TCD4+, TCD8+ lymphocytes and M1 macrophages to the renal tissue was observed, while B cells in the heart decreased. A renal tissue repair response characterized by Foxp3 activation predominated. However, a more inflammatory profile was shown in the heart tissue influenced by IL-17RA and IL-1β. In conclusion, the AKI generated by renal I/R was able to activate and recruit T and B lymphocytes and macrophages, as well as pro-inflammatory mediators to renal and cardiac tissue, showing the role of the immune system as a bridge between both organs in the context of CRS 3.
