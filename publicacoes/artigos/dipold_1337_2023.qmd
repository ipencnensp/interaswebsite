abstract: > 
  Random lasers have been studied using many materials, but only a couple have used glass matrices. Here, we present a study of zinc tellurite and aluminum oxide doped with different percentages of neodymium oxide (4 wt.%, 8 wt.%, and 16 wt.%) and demonstrate for the first time random laser action at 1337 nm. Laser emission was verified and the laser pulse’s rise time and input–output power slope were obtained. A cavity composed of the sample’s pump surface and an effective mirror formed by a second, parallel layer at the gain-loss boundary was probably the main lasing mechanism of this random laser system. The reason for the absence of emission at 1064 nm is thought to be a measured temperature rise in the samples’ active volume.
