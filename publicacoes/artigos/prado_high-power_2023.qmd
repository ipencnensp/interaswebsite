abstract: > 
  Three laser resonators are demonstrated emitting at 1053 nm and pumped at 797 nm by volume Bragg grating-equipped diodes, achieving the highest reported efficiencies for Nd:YLF in a four-level system, to the best of our knowledge. A peak output power of 880 W is achieved by pumping the crystal with a diode stack of 1.4 kW of peak pump power.
