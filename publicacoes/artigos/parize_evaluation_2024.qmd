  Background: Peri-implantitis is characterized as a pathological change in the tissues around dental implants. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) provides molecular information from optical phenomena observed by the vibration of molecules, being used in biological studies to characterize changes and serving as a form of diagnosis. Aims: this case-control study evaluated the peri-implant disease by using FTIR spectroscopy with attenuated total reflectance (ATR) in the fingerprint region. Methods: forty saliva samples were evaluated, 18 from the control group and 22 from the peri-implantitis group. Clinical data such as plaque index (PI), gingival index (GI), probing depth (PS) and attachment level (AL) were assessed. Results: The results of clinical parameters showed statistical difference between the two groups regarding an excess of the plaque index (PI). In the FTIR-ATR analysis, the main components revealed vibrational modes of fatty acids, histidine, lipid esters, nucleic acids and tryptophan, with the main molecules contributing to spectral discrimination. The five-component PLS-DA classification model had an accuracy of 81%, showing differences between healthy and diseased implants. Conclusion: the FTIR spectroscopy provides important molecular characteristics of the samples and that the results in association with clinical data show the effectiveness of using this tool for diagnosing the disease.
