  The pulse length for ultrashort pulse lasers is considered shorter than the thermal vibration period of the material lattice. The thermal diffusion depth is negligible when compared with the optical penetration depth because laser-matter interaction occurs only near the focal volume. Hence, ultrashort pulse lasers are indicated for micromachining. This study aims to evaluate straight and zig-zag texture patterns generated by ultrashort laser pulses on the rake face of uncoated cemented carbide tools during the turning of martensitic stainless steel. The tests were performed under dry and lubricated conditions. The output variables were machining force, cutting power, chip thickness ratio and aspects of workpiece quality (form tolerance and surface roughness). The textures presented micrometric dimensions with a narrow deviation. The main results showed that the straight texture pattern decreased the machining force by 17.5% when compared to the zig-zag pattern. For cutting power, the straight pattern reduced consumption by 5.8% and 6.9% in relation to the reference and zig-zag tools, respectively. Finally, under dry machining conditions, the straight tool was able to decrease the workpiece cylindricity deviation by an average of 108% and 25% compared to the reference and zig-zag tools. The results provide evidence that texturing can affect the tribological system, chip-tool interface, with a potential impact on the sustainability of the process.
